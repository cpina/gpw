Fssword Generator
 
This password generator gives you a list of ten
"pronounceable" passwords. It is modeled after Morrie
Gasser's original generator described in
 
   * Gasser, M., A Random Word Generator for Pronouncable
     Passwords, MTR-3006, The Mitre Corporation, Bedford, MA
     01730, ESD-TR-75-97, HQ Electronic Systems Division,
     Hanscom AFB, MA 01731. NTIS AD A 017676.
 
except that Morrie's used a second-order approximation to
English and this generator uses a third-order approximation.
A descendant of Gasser's generator was added to the Multics
operating system by Project Guardian in the mid 70s, and I
believe Digital's VMS added a similar feature in the 80s.  FIPS
Standard 181 describes a similar digraph-based generator,
derived from Gasser's.or details on gpw go to

The first digraph-based password generator I know of was written
by Daniel J. Edwards about 1965 for MIT's CTSS timesharing
system.
 
Understand that the passwords produced by this generator are
only as "strong" as the initial source of randomness. Therefore,
the best way to use this generator is to take its output and
modify it in ways known only to you.  Make some letters capital,
or insert punctuation and numbers.
