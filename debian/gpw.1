.SH NAME
gpw \- program to generate pronounceable passwords
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gpw
.RI [ number_of_passwords \ [ length_of_passwords ] ] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B gpw
command.
This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
because the original program does not have a manual page.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
\fBGpw\fP is a program that generate pronounceable passwords of whatever
length is desidered. It uses the statistics of three-letter combinations 
(trigraphs) of the english system dictionary. It is based on the ideas 
in Morrie Gasser's password generator for Multics, and Dan Edwards's 
generator for CTSS.  FIPS Standard 181 describes a similar digraph-based 
generator, derived from Gasser's.
.SH OPTIONS
This program accepts two optional numbers as command\-line arguments.
The first value is the number of password to generate, the second one is
the length of the passwords required, up to 99. 
Defaults are 10 and 8 respectively.
.SH NOTE
Password length should be choosen consistently with the encryption 
standard used.
.br
So, a value of eight is useful with DES encryption, and a longer value
should be used with MD5 encryption. 
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR passwd (1), pwgen(1).
