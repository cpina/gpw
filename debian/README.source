gpw for Debian
--------------

The original program source are still distributed in non-aggregated form by
the author. At the time of first packaging, when I was young and silly, I 
created a fake tarball collecting together all required stuff and my own
little changes to the build makefile and introduced a conventional versioning.
After 14 years I found quite pointless trying to change that in better terms.
